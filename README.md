# LD-AS
Language Identification and Analytics System is an application that is fulfilled with the Language Analytics feature. This feature is an ability to understand relevant information of documents and learn from annotation or past experiences that processed through Tone Analyser an IBM Cloud Service. In the end, it forms as a system that provides a tone analysis of inputs from its trained knowledge that has driven from different learning paths.

Our Idea is to respond to this problem by the Language Detection & Analytics System that helps
to instantly detect any official language listed in international records. Our System can input in
any official language, it detects language by its code under the list ISO639 - III. We use the model
of IBM Language Detector that has a huge dataset about understanding language. It uses Natural
Language Processing to parse the targeted text and return the Code.

## General Specification

It is a Cloud-based Tone Analysis system that supports a wide range of languages. It based on
communication datasets and NLP models.
- Watson services ​ provide a wide perspective about a different kind of global variant
system.
- NLP model ​ takes an incoming message and parse given input then returns the
information on the decision of intents.
- Tone Analysis ​ helps us to interpret the linguistic text, then with the help of NLP models it
gathers information. In the last, it marked emotion with the accuracy score.
